XYZ-Stickers
============

XYZ stickers for marking the axes of inertial sensors and IMUs on objects.  The stickers are intended to be printed in the sticker books sold by [moo.com](http://uk.moo.com/).  Each page contains 6 stickers, one for each orientation of the axes.  The axes follow the [right-hand rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule) and the common 'RGB = XYZ' colour convention where: Red is X, Green is Y and Z is Blue.

See the [original post]( http://www.x-io.co.uk/xyz-stickers/) on the x-io website for more information.
